## Data Governance & Lineage Toolkit

This repository provides a rigorous framework for financial machine learning data governance, lineage, and theoretical proof logging. It combines symbolic mathematics, cryptographic hashing, distributed ledger notarization, and theorem registry export.

### Features

- ‚úÖ Symbolic proof generation and reversibility verification (using SymPy).
- ‚úÖ Immutable SHA256 proof hashing.
- ‚úÖ Automated symbolic proof log saving.
- ‚úÖ Distributed ledger notarization of proofs.
- ‚úÖ Continuous symbolic stream validation.
- ‚úÖ Export proofs to public theorem registries.
- ‚úÖ Automatic LaTeX snippet generation for inclusion in compliance or academic reports.

### Example Transformation

```python
f(x) = (x - 5)/2
f_inverse(x) = 2x + 5
```

Verified in code:
```python
assert sp.simplify(2 * ((x - 5)/2) + 5 - x) == 0
```

### Workflow

1Ô∏è‚É£ Define symbolic transformations and inverses.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Save symbolic logs with canonical representations.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate cryptographic proof hashes.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Notarize hashes to a distributed ledger (local JSON-based ledger).

5Ô∏è‚É£ Validate symbolic streams for correctness continuously.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Export proofs to a theorem registry.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Create LaTeX snippets automatically.

### Example Usage

```bash
python data-governance-lineage-toolkit.py
```

### Output Artifacts

- `logs/symbolic/` ‚Äî Symbolic proof logs.
- `logs/distributed_ledger/` ‚Äî Ledger entries for proof hashes.
- `logs/public_registry/` ‚Äî Registry-ready proof exports.
- `logs/latex/` ‚Äî LaTeX proof snippets.

### Compliance

Designed to support strong auditability and reproducibility in regulated environments (GDPR, BCBS 239), while ensuring mathematical rigor and transparency.
